    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <p class="story-text">
      BH Motors started as a vision to create a clean, user-friendly platform for showcasing premium vehicles. Over the course of this
      project, we designed and built a fully structured website with six pages, each tailored to provide a specific experienceâ€”from browsing
      car models to registering for test drives. Along the way, we tackled challenges like form validation, integrating personalized user
      data with localStorage, and ensuring responsive design across devices. By researching best practices and rigorously testing our work,
      we delivered a website that is both functional and visually engaging.
