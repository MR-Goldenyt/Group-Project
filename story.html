        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            This project involved designing and implementing a classified website for BH Motors. We created six
            structured pages, each serving a specific purpose. Challenges included form validation, localStorage
            integration, and responsive design. We overcame these by researching best practices and testing thoroughly.
            Through this project, we learned how to build maintainable, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript.
